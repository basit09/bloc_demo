# bloc_task

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I have used bloc as state management and called an API, stored data in local DB (Sqflite), 
Have shown data from local DB if data is empty from API call on refreshed.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
